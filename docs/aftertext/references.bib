  abstract = {{Background: Successful treatment of melanoma depends directly on early diagnosis. Such a diagnosis is based on clinical examination and dermatoscopy. Recently, automated instruments for melanoma detection are under development. Objective: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic possibilities provided by clinical and dermatoscopic examinations and by a computerized telespectrophotometric system (TS). Methods: The study involves a consecutive series of 298 patients with 313 cutaneous pigmented lesions (66 melanomas and 247 non-melanoma lesions). Each lesion was subjected to the triple diagnostic evaluation, before surgery. Results were expressed in terms of sensitivity and specificity of each kind of evaluation. Results: Clinical evaluation had sensitivity and specificity values of 86 and 77\%, respectively, whereas dermatoscopy gave corresponding values of 91 and 74\%. TS assessment resulted in a sensitivity of 80\% and a specificity of 49\%. Differences between clinical and dermatoscopic diagnoses lacked statistical significance (p = 0.22), whereas there was a significant difference comparing both clinical and TS evaluations (p \&lt; 0.01) and dermatoscopic and TS evaluations (p \&lt; 0.01). Combining clinical and dermatoscopic evaluations, a sensitivity of 97\% was achieved. Addition of TS has not changed this figure. Conclusions: Results of this study confirm and stress the importance of dermatoscopy in the diagnosis of melanoma. Clinical evaluation coupled with dermatoscopy can be considered the cornerstone of such a diagnosis. Although TS is able to achieve interesting results, at present it cannot significantly compete with any of the other tested methods.}},

  abstract = {Abstract Survival from melanoma is inversely related to tumour thickness and is less favorable for those in lower socioeconomic (SES) strata. Reasons for this are unclear but may relate to a lower prevalence of skin screening. Our aim was to examine the association between melanoma thickness, individual-level SES and clinical skin examination (CSE) using a population-based case-control study. Cases were Queensland (Australia) residents aged 20–75 years with a histologically confirmed first primary invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2003. Telephone interviews were completed by 3,762 cases (77.7\%) and 3,824 (50.4\%) controls. Thickness was dichotomized to thin (≤2 mm) and thick (>2 mm). Compared with controls, the risk of thick melanoma was significantly increased among men [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.56, 95\% CI = 1.22–2.00], older participants (RRR = 1.76, 95\% CI = 1.10–2.82), those educated to primary level (RRR = 1.70, 95\% CI = 1.08–2.66), not married/living as married (RRR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 1.15–1.88), retired (RRR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.01–1.94) and not having a CSE in past 3 years (RRR = 1.45, 95\% CI = 1.12–1.86). There was a significant trend to increasing prevalence of CSE with higher education (p < 0.01) and the benefit of CSE in reducing the risk of thick melanoma was most pronounced among that subgroup. There were no significant associations between cases with thin melanoma and controls. Melanoma thickness at presentation is significantly associated with educational level, other measures of SES and absence of CSE. Public health education efforts should focus on identifying new avenues that specifically target those subgroups of the population who are at increased risk of being diagnosed with thick melanoma.},
